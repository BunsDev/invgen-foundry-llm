Function: depositETH

Vulnerable Reason: {{The 'depositETH' function allows users to deposit ETH by specifying the destination chain ID, resource ID, and data. The function accepts ETH as the fee for the deposit and transfers the remaining ETH to the handler contract using the 'IWETH' interface. However, there is a potential vulnerability in the calculation of the 'amount' variable where the function uses assembly code to retrieve the value of the ETH sent with the transaction. If the assembly code is manipulated by an attacker to return a different value, it could lead to an incorrect calculation of the deposit amount, resulting in a loss of funds.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: The invariant test should return false if an incorrect amount calculation occurs in the 'depositETH' function due to a manipulated assembly code returning a different value for the amount of ETH sent with the transaction.
