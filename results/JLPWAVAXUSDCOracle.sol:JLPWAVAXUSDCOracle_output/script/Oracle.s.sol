/** 
Function: peek

Vulnerable Reason: {{The 'peek' function in the JLPWAVAXUSDCOracle contract directly calls the '_get' function to return the price without any checks or validation. This can lead to potential oracle price manipulation as the price returned by 'peek' may not be accurate or consistent with the actual market price. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the 'peek' function multiple times within the same block to manipulate the reported price, causing potential harm to users relying on the oracle for accurate price information.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: Check if the 'peek' function in the JLPWAVAXUSDCOracle contract directly calls the '_get' function without any time-weighted average price mechanism implemented to prevent potential single block manipulation. The test should verify if the reported price returned by 'peek' is consistent and accurate with the actual market price, considering potential manipulation within the same block.

/** 
Function: peekSpot

Vulnerable Reason: {{The peekSpot function in the JLPWAVAXUSDCOracle contract directly calls the peek function without performing any additional validations or checks. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the peek function is modified in a way that introduces a vulnerability. For example, if the peek function is modified to return incorrect or manipulated data, the peekSpot function will also return the same incorrect data without any safeguards.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: The vulnerability can be triggered if the peekSpot function in the JLPWAVAXUSDCOracle contract is modified to return manipulated or incorrect data without any additional validations or checks, which would result in the peekSpot function also returning the same manipulated data. To write an invariant test, we can simulate a scenario where the peek function returns unexpected data (e.g., a hardcoded incorrect value) and check if the peekSpot function also returns the same incorrect value without any safeguards in place. This can be done by deploying a test contract that interacts with the JLPWAVAXUSDCOracle contract and triggers the peekSpot function after manipulating the peek function.
