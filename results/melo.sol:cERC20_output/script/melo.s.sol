What this invariant tries to do: A reentrancy vulnerability exists in the balanceOf function of the cERC20 contract due to the possibility of recursive calls from transfer or transferFrom functions.

By calling increaseAllowance multiple times with a significant addedValue, an attacker could deplete the contract's token balance, leading to a situation where the contract is unable to operate due to lack of token funds.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: After each call to increaseAllowance with a large addedValue parameter, the contract's token balance should be decreased by the same amount. Write an invariant test that checks if the contract's totalSupply is decreasing proportionally to the addedValue parameter in increaseAllowance function calls.

Function: decreaseAllowance

Vulnerable Reason: {{The decreaseAllowance function does not check for the case where the subtractedValue is greater than the current allowance amount. This can lead to an attacker reducing the allowance below zero by repeatedly calling decreaseAllowance with a large subtractedValue, potentially allowing them to transfer tokens without proper authorization.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: When calling decreaseAllowance with a subtractedValue greater than the current allowance amount, the function should revert if the vulnerability is present. We can write an invariant test to check if the allowance decreases below zero in this scenario.
