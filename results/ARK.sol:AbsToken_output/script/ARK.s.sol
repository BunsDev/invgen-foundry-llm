/** 
Function: setExcludeContract

Vulnerable Reason: {{The function setExcludeContract allows the contract owner to exclude a specific address from certain actions. However, there is a lack of proper access control in this function, as it is only restricted to the contract owner (owner). This means that any external user can potentially call this function and modify the excluded address list, which could lead to unauthorized access and control over critical contract functionalities.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: Check the _isExcludedContract state variable and the result of the excludeHolder view function after each transaction to ensure that only authorized addresses are excluded and that unauthorized users cannot modify the excluded address list.
