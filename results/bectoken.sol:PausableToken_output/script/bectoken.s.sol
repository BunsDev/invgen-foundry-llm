LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: After each transaction, one should check the balance of the sender address to ensure that it has not decreased below the transferred amount. This can be verified by retrieving the balance of the sender address using the 'balances' mapping in the contract, and comparing it with the expected balance after the transaction. Additionally, one can use a view function to retrieve the balance of the sender address and confirm that it matches the expected value after the transfer operation.
