/** 
Function: propose

Vulnerable Reason: {{The 'propose' function allows any user to create a proposal without proper validation of the proposal content. This can lead to manipulation of governance voting results by submitting malicious proposals that may influence the voting outcome in an unauthorized manner. For example, an attacker could propose a fake upgrade that looks beneficial but actually contains malicious code to manipulate the system.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: The invariant test should check whether the 'propose' function properly validates the proposal content to prevent manipulation of governance voting results. Specifically, it should validate that the proposal contains valid parameters (_diamondCut, _init, _calldata, _pauseOrUnpause) and that the proposer has enough stake to propose. If the proposal content is not properly validated, the vulnerability is triggered.

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: The invariant test would check whether the 'unvote' function allows a user to unvote on a proposal that has already passed the required threshold for execution. Specifically, the test would verify that the 'unvote' function does not include a check to prevent unvoting on proposals that have already met the execution threshold, potentially allowing users to manipulate governance voting results.

This can lead to unauthorized parties pausing or unpausing the contract, disrupting its normal operation and potentially causing harm to users or the protocol.}}

What this invariant tries to do: The vulnerability can be evaluated by checking if the pauseOrUnpause function can be triggered by an unauthorized entity without proper checks in place.
