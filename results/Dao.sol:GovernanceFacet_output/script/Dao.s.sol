Function: vote

Vulnerable Reason: {{The 'vote' function allows users to vote on proposals without checking if the proposal has already ended, potentially leading to manipulation of governance voting results. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by continuously voting on proposals that should no longer be active, influencing the voting outcome in their favor.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: After each transaction, one should check the 'isActive' status of the proposal being voted on to ensure that the proposal has not ended before allowing the user to vote. This check can be performed by verifying the 'isActive' status of the proposal through the state variable 's.g.bips[bip].active' in the contract GovernanceFacet.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by continuously voting on proposals that should no longer be active, influencing the voting outcome in their favor.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: After each 'vote' transaction, it should be checked if the proposal being voted on is still active (not ended) by verifying the 'isActive' function. Additionally, the 'voted' function should be checked to ensure that the user has not already voted on the proposal to prevent duplicate votes. These checks are crucial to prevent manipulation of governance voting results by voting on ended proposals or voting multiple times on the same proposal.
