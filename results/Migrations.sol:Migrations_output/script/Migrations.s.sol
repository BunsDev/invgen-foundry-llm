/** 
Function: setCompleted

Vulnerable Reason: {{The 'setCompleted' function allows any address other than the owner to set the 'last_completed_migration' variable. This could potentially lead to unauthorized parties manipulating the completion status of migrations, thereby affecting the governance voting results or causing other unintended consequences. For example, an attacker could repeatedly call this function with different completed values to manipulate the migration status and influence governance decisions.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: An invariant test will check that the 'setCompleted' function can only be called by the owner address to set the 'last_completed_migration' variable. The test will verify that a non-owner address is unable to modify the completion status of migrations, thereby preventing unauthorized manipulation of governance voting results.

Function: setCompleted

Vulnerable Reason: {{The setCompleted function allows any user to set the last_completed_migration variable to an arbitrary value without proper validation or constraints. This can lead to manipulation of migration progress and potentially disrupt the intended sequence of migrations, causing inconsistencies in the contract state or affecting the migration process.}}

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: An invariant test would check that the last_completed_migration variable is only updated by the owner of the contract within a reasonable range of values (e.g., within a specific range or based on certain conditions). The test would trigger a false evaluation if a non-owner can set last_completed_migration to an arbitrary value without proper validation or constraints.
