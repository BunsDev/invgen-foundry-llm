Vulnerable Reason: {{The 'repayBorrowBehalf' function allows any address to repay a borrow on behalf of another address without proper access control.

LLM Likelihood: high

What this invariant tries to do: After each transaction, one should check the total amount of borrowed assets for the borrower account and compare it with the amount that was actually repaid on behalf. This check involves querying the total borrowed amount for the borrower from the contract's state variables or using a view function. Any discrepancy between the borrowed amount and the amount repaid could indicate potential exploitation of the vulnerability.
